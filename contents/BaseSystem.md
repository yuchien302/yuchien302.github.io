#### Problems####


Working at security operating center (SOC) means we have to 
With the need of acquiring information from any given Intranet IP when monitoring network traffic and virus incident, I built BaseSystem that aggregate data from asset management system, anti-virus management console, Windows <span style="color:red">Server</span> Update Services, and excel file of internal phone book. On top of that, I use NodeJS, ReactJS and Flux to provide a Web Interface.

This system has been used on an hourly basis from all the member in Security Operation Center. The amount of time to gather same amount of information given an IP has been reduced from ~5 minutes to less then 3 sec.
