### Problems ###

Given an intranet IP address, we always need to gather information by manually login to different systems to get what we want. It was a tedious and time-consuming job that often take around 3 minutes.

### Challenge ###

Timing is the most crucial part of this project. SOC is a busy and challenging place to work, and you only have limited amount of free time because of the nature of Military Service. 

Maintainability and Stability are two other things parts, as it is an internal tool, and I won't be able to maintain it after leaving.

### My Roles ###

I am a sole developer in this project. I designed the interface, write Back-end code with NodeJS, Front-end with ReactJS, Flux, and MYSQL task for aggregating data from multiple remote MSSQL.
